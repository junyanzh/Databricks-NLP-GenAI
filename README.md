# Databricks NLP & GenAI with PySpark

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI (GenAI) on the Databricks platform using PySpark. The project leverages Databricks for big data processing and analysis, combining state-of-the-art NLP techniques and generative models to extract and explain insights from textual data.

### Explanation of the Flow
1. **DBFS (Data Storage)**  
   Raw data is stored in the Databricks File System (DBFS), ensuring scalable and secure data management.

2. **Notebook Environment**  
   Databricks notebooks are used to write PySpark code and orchestrate data processing workflows.

3. **Text Preprocessing (Spark)**  
   Spark cleans and transforms the raw text data, preparing it for further NLP tasks.

4. **NLP Processing (Spark)**  
   Advanced NLP techniques are applied to extract topics and insights from the processed text data.

5. **Generative AI: Meta Llama 3.3**  
   A generative AI model (e.g., Meta Llama 3.3) provides detailed explanations of identified topics and generates concise summaries.

6. **MLflow Experiment Tracking**  
   MLflow tracks experiments, monitors model performance, and manages model versions for reproducibility and collaboration.

7. **Visualization (Spark)**  
   Spark generates visualizations and dashboards to present analytical results in an interpretable manner.

## Summary
- Integrates NLP and Generative AI using PySpark on Databricks.
- Processes text data to extract insights and generate AI-driven explanations.
- Leverages distributed computing to efficiently handle large-scale datasets.
